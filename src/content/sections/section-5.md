To thoroughly understand the gig economy's nuanced impacts, it's crucial to distinguish two distinct yet interconnected groups: physically migrated gig workers and telemigrants (virtual gig workers).

Physically migrated gig workers relocate to wealthier countries, often undertaking lower-tier, physically demanding roles such as ride-sharing or delivery services. These workers frequently operate under precarious conditions, earning marginally above minimum wage, with limited access to labor protections or social benefits (Center for Global Development, 2024).

Conversely, telemigrants provide digital labor remotely from their home countries, engaged in tasks like AI content moderation or data labeling. Despite geographical separation, these workers experience severe economic exploitation, often earning below subsistence wages, significantly lower than their physically migrating counterparts. Venezuelan telemigrants performing AI annotation tasks exemplify this stark reality, earning approximately $2 per hour, highlighting acute economic disparities (El País, 2023).

Our comparative wage visualization graphically underscores this extreme wage disparity, contrasting digital nomads’ relative affluence with physically migrated gig workers' modest earnings and telemigrants' severe economic precarity. This visual starkly emphasizes that despite nominal global labor mobility, entrenched systemic inequalities remain, necessitating urgent ethical and regulatory interventions to ensure equitable labor standards across global markets.
