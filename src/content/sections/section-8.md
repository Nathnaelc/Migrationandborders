In response to growing exploitation and algorithmic injustice, gig workers around the world have mobilized with remarkable resolve. From street-level strikes to legal petitions, they have asserted their right to dignity, safety, and fair compensation.

In Nairobi, content moderators employed by outsourcing firm Sama to screen graphic material for Meta filed a lawsuit against the company in 2023. They alleged unlawful termination, trauma, and union-busting, marking one of the most high-profile legal actions against a Big Tech subcontractor to date (TIME). This case catalyzed public debate around the invisibility of digital labor and the psychological toll borne by those behind the screens.

Elsewhere, delivery drivers in Spain organized under Riders x Derechos and achieved the landmark "Riders Law," reclassifying them as employees entitled to benefits and protections (The Guardian). In India, platform workers have formed unions across states, leveraging both street protests and digital campaigns to pressure the government to extend labor protections.

These movements do not emerge in a vacuum. They reflect global trends in worker consciousness, digital solidarity, and a willingness to resist—even under risk of job loss or legal intimidation. From Kenya to the Philippines to Brazil, interviews with gig workers consistently reveal frustration over low pay, lack of control, and algorithmic opacity. Yet they also voice an unwavering desire for justice and inclusion in the systems they sustain (El País).

To bring these stories to life, our proposed interactive timeline visualizes key moments of resistance in the global gig economy. It includes labor strikes, court cases, policy wins, and testimonials, each a node of courage in an ecosystem often defined by precarity. This timeline underscores that behind every statistic lies human resolve, and behind every algorithm, a structure that can be contested.
