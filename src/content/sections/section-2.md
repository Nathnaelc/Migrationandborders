Digital nomads represent a distinctive and privileged segment of the global workforce. Typically hailing from affluent nations, these individuals leverage remote work opportunities and specialized visas to reside temporarily in countries offering appealing cultural experiences, climates, and lower living costs (Ledsom, 2025). The proliferation of digital nomad visas across more than 25 countries underscores how governments actively attract these high-income remote workers, recognizing them as potential economic stimulants rather than competitors in local labor markets (Fernandez & Shapiro, 2024).

These visa programs typically require applicants to demonstrate significant monthly earnings, such as the average minimum income of $2,853 per month in 2025. This income threshold ensures applicants come predominantly from wealthier economic backgrounds, reinforcing existing global income inequalities (Fernandez & Shapiro, 2024). The explicit goal of these policies is to inject foreign capital into local economies without impacting domestic employment.


### Economic Arbitrage and Local Impact

Digital nomads often strategically choose destinations to maximize their purchasing power, a practice known as geographic arbitrage. For instance, a digital nomad earning a typical American salary of approximately $3,000 per month could enjoy significantly higher living standards in cities like Chiang Mai, Bali, or Lisbon compared to high-cost locations such as San Francisco or New York. This arbitrage effect is vividly illustrated through our interactive visualization, highlighting cities with a high Arbitrage Index. This index, calculated by comparing the median American remote workerâ€™s salary ($3,000/month) to local nomadic living costs, clearly demonstrates where nomads' purchasing power is maximized.

Yet, this advantageous economic positioning carries substantial local consequences. In popular digital nomad hubs such as Lisbon, Mexico City, and Bali, the influx of high-income nomads has significantly driven up housing costs and contributed to rapid gentrification (Gill et al., 2022). Such impacts are starkly represented in our visualization through the Cost of Living and Arbitrage Index metrics. This evidence underscores how digital nomads' privilege, while individually beneficial, often exacerbates local inequalities.
