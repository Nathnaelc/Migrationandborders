Gig workers often encounter intensive algorithmic control, facing opaque algorithms that manage task allocation, surveillance, and even worker termination. For instance, Uber's facial recognition system disproportionately misidentifies drivers of color, leading to unjust algorithmic deactivations (TIME, 2021). AI-driven management extends beyond operational control, severely impacting workers' mental health, particularly among AI content moderators. Workers in Kenya contracted by OpenAI experienced PTSD-like symptoms from reviewing traumatic content, highlighting the profound ethical issues embedded in "ghost work" (TIME, 2023).

These workers operate with minimal protections, their precarious status exacerbated by the lack of clear regulatory frameworks and accountability mechanisms. Ethical considerations demand scrutiny of these exploitative practices, advocating for transparent algorithmic governance, human oversight, and robust psychological support systems. Addressing these human rights concerns requires collective courage from policymakers, companies, and civil society to establish just labor conditions within the global digital economy.
